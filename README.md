React Test-Driven Development & Design Patterns with TypeScript

This repository contains a series of mini React projects developed using a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach with TypeScript.

The primary goal of this repo is to practice and recap React TDD fundamentals, with a strong focus on coding patterns and best practices rather than on building feature-rich applications.
